Involved in the conception, planning, obtaining funding, staffing and supervision of two major programmes of research within the centre.\n1)    Investigation of non-communicable diseases in low/middle income communities.\nSouth Asians (individuals from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka), who represent a quarter of the world's population, along with Arabs and Africans, account for 60% of the world's heart disease patients. This includes cardiomyopathies and aggressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is an area of intense current public scrutiny, especially in relation to low/ middle income blue collar workers who are residents in the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where there are significant opportunities for employment, particularly from the surrounding countries of the Indian sub-continent, due to their immense infrastructure building projects. Data suggests that the prevalence of NCDs is high in these workers, but perhaps comparable to that seen amongst the host (Qatari) population and to the workers\u2019 countries of origin (e.g. India, Nepal, Bangladesh). Young people from these ethnicities, especially men, with moderate-to-severe structural heart abnormalities are found to be asymptomatic and have no clinical signs, with the first indication often being sudden cardiac death. A screening programme including extensive clinical information, including ECG, and multi-omics data, is likely to predict subjects with \u2018silent\u2019 underlying heart disease. Timely disqualification from strenuous occupations and moderate behavioral changes could be life-saving, especially on building sites in Qatar.Study 1. Set-up, obtained funding (QRCS internal grant \u00a3150,000), supervised and completed a pilot study of 58,270 blue collar, male workers from low/middle income communities, resident in Qatar, looking at the association between their length of stay with the diagnosis of NCDs, using a descriptive, retrospective model, including basic demographics. Eighty-three percent of the population were between the ages of 25 \u2013 55 years and predominantly from the Indian sub-continent, accounting for 90%. The majority (84.5%) of this population had also been resident in Qatar for 3 or more years, with greater than 96% of the studied population having been resident in Qatar for more than 12 months. The top reasons for visits to the clinic were due to hypertension, dyslipidaemia and/or diabetes, and associated with multiple visits to the clinic, requiring chronic treatment and monitoring.Study 2. To further study NCDs within this poorly studied population, obtained funding (\u00a32.0 million) from Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy Qatar 2022 for the screening of 20,000 male, low middle income blue collar workers, registered at the QRCS clinics. The parameters screened for were medical history, complete and comprehensive medical screening, including ECG, routine laboratory investigations and blood collections. This comprehensive, clinical database has been quality checked. Samples from these subjects have been stored for omics studies, including serum and whole blood for DNA extraction. The screening was approved by a nationally registered Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written consent. Currently DNA has been extracted from a representative sub-group (n=8,000) of these subjects, and passed quantitative and qualitative quality control measures. In view of the enormity of the undertaking the analysis will be done in stages, with an optimum of 5,000 (minimum n=1,000) samples, being analysed at each stage, until all the 20,000 samples have been completed. We aim to carry out multi-omics analyses (whole genome sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics) on this sub-group in collaboration with institutions based in Qatar and various collaborators at UCL.Funding application \u2013 awaiting outcome (end August 2021). Funding for the initial omics analyses has been applied for (\u00a36 million over 3 years) from Qatar Foundation. As the analysis progresses and the numbers increase beyond n=5,000 this is likely to attract industry partners interested in using this information to gain insights into the evolving area of genome science, with a view to identifying new genes and biomarkers which could lead the development of innovative diagnostics and treatments tailored to these ethnicities and communities.         \nThe mission of the center is to contribute to the health of populations from low/middle income communities by investigating the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on them and tailoring diagnostics and therapeutics based on these findings.2)     Generation of dromedary camel VHH fragments for therapeutics and diagnostics of inflammatory diseases.\nDevelopment of camelid VHHs for use in diagnostics and as drugs has generated much recent interest. Recently (2014\u2013present), publications have continued to grow and more VHHs have entered into clinical trials or advanced closer to the market. The first VHH-based drug (Caplacizumab; bivalent anti-vWF nanobody for treating rare blood clotting disorders) reached the market in February 2019 (www.ablynx.com). Meanwhile, IP limitations on VHHs are diminishing and more biotechnology companies are showing interest in commercialization of these domain antibodies as therapeutics, diagnostics, and research reagents.Funding for setting up platform (2016 \u2013 ongoing). Secured funding, identified staffing and established a platform for producing VHH fragments in Doha, using the available technology. Over the past three years, the platform has developed several leads, directed against various immunomodulatory targets.Private funding. A funding (\u00a32 million) application has been submitted to private venture capitalists for the camel antibody platform. Three rounds of successful review have been completed and the outcome should be received by the end of August 2021.\nCurrently, CoMI is in the process of being recognized as operating on two sites, one based at the Royal Free Campus, London (CoMI-R) and the other in Doha, Qatar, in allocated premises within the building of the Anti-Doping Lab Qatar (ADLQ), CoMI-Q.\nQatar Red Crescent Society (QRCS)\nJoined as CEO in 2001 with a budget of \u00a31,000,000, operating only within Qatar, with 25 staff members. In 2020, stepped down as president, with a budget of \u00a3250,000,000, and 2,500 staff (1000 in Qatar and 1,500 internationally). As CEO, was in charge of building up the organisation, setting strategy, execution and raising of funds locally and internationally. In addition, the humanitarian activities of QRCS has impacted the lives of 13 million people in 2020, including the provision of primary healthcare for 1.2 million people within Qatar.ASPETAR, Qatar Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Hospital\nWas Director General from 2000 to 2012, in charge of 700 staff with projects value of \u00a3100,000,000, and a yearly budget of \u00a380,000,000\nDeveloped the concept, terms of reference, models of care delivery and all other aspects of setting up until commissioning. Was further recognised as a Centre of Excellence for sports medicine by FIFA and more recently a Centre of Research Excellence for pain management in athletes by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).\nThe concept of the facility and model of care was the first of its kind globally, specialising in sports medicine.Anti-Doping Lab Qatar\nWas Director General of the project (2008) until it opened 2012. Developed the concept, obtained governmental funding and political support from Gulf Cooperation Countries to be the west Asian regional laboratory. Became the Chair of Board of Trustees in 2012, overseeing an annual budget of \u00a330,000,000. The lab was internationally accredited for testing elite, competing athletes for prohibited sport performance-enhancing substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2015.\nNaufar (Qatar Addiction Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre)\nIs Director General of a rehabilitation centre for substance use disorders. First of its kind in Qatar. The total cost of the project was \u00a3170,000,000, with an annual budget of \u00a380,000,000. In 2018 the hospital gained accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).\n\n\n== Teaching and student supervision ==\n\n\n=== Non-resident PhD programme (2011 - ongoing) ===\nInitiated, obtained funding, found potential students and was actively involved in the planning for a non-resident PhD programme between UCL and ADLQ, that was expanded to cover students/staff from Qatar University and Hamad Medical Corp. This programme was aimed specifically, though not exclusively, at female scientists with young families, to help them progress in science and realise their full potential, without being hampered by an inability to travel freely and spend extended periods abroad. This programme has been expanded with the help of other colleagues within ADLQ, UCL, University of Bristol and University of Groningen, as well as, other institutions within Qatar. To date it has successfully helped to train over a dozen women to doctoral level.  \n\nPost-doctoral Training programme (2019 \u2013 ongoing)\nA major challenge for all institutions in Qatar, as local scientists qualify at the post-graduate and doctoral levels, is of keeping them motivated, interested and developing to their utmost within their chosen scientific areas.  This is especially important if Qatar is to achieve any degree of self-sufficiency in truly becoming a centre for research and development. While this is challenging anywhere, in a place like Qatar where many of the young scientists soon after qualifying and even prior to getting any real job experience are enticed into middle/senior management positions, and/or also are, in the majority, women, often having to juggle with familial and social responsibilities, there is a greater need to provide them with an extremely attractive, prestigious, well-structured and supported programme to enable this.\nInitiated and set-up a fellowship programme to address the need for the preparation of scientists wanting to pursue an academic career by providing a training experience that combines both research and teaching excellence. The goals of this programme are to facilitate the progress of postdoctoral scholars toward careers in research to ensure Qatar's capacity building in this sphere. Specifically, the Fellowship programme aims at providing advanced, independent research experience, productivity in the form of peer-reviewed publications, improvement of the Fellows\u2019 technical skills, acquiring teaching, mentoring and supervision skills.\n\n\n== Specific students\u2019 supervision ==\nPhD - UK\n\n    1999 \u2013 2002 - Khader Mahmoud Alsayfi, \u2018Information systems and healthcare.\u2019-   Department of Medicine, University of Hull, UK\n\n  2010 \u2013 2013 \u2013 Ahmed Sultan, \u2018Diabetes and obesity in South Asians.\u2019-   Division of Medicine, University of Liverpool, UK\nPhD - Europe\n\n2016-2019 \u2013 Abdullah Mohamed ElSafti, \u2018Acute and chronic diagnosis of Syrian war victims and refugees in field hospitals and internally displaced peoples\u2019 camps in Syria and Turkey, during the Syrian Civil War.\u2019-   Dept of Emergency Medicine, Universitair Zienkenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel), Brussels, Belgium \u2013 Role - Primary supervisor, with Prof Dr Ives Hubloue.\nPhD \u2013 Africa\n\n      2015 \u2013 2019 \u2013 Babiker Elmubarak Hamed, \u2018The prevalence and effect of theileria parasite on blood count and kidney function in dromedary camels in Qatar.\u2019-   Dept of Veterinary Medicine, Khartoum University, Khartoum, Sudan - Role - Primary supervisor, with Prof Amal Bhakhit.\nMSc (Research)\n\n\u00b7      2010 - 2013 \u2013 Khadija Saad, Wadha Abushreeda - Universiti sains Malaysia (USM)  \n\u00b7      2018 - 2020 \u2013 Maryam AlNesf - University of BristolOther teaching activities\n\n    2005 \u2013 ongoing: Responsible for setting up a 1-year taught MA programme in international humanitarian law at the Islamic University of Maldives (formerly College of Islamic Studies) Male, Maldives.
