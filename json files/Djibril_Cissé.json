After seven years at the club, he had a six-month spell at N\u00eemes Olympique, before moving to AJ Auxerre, joining the club's youth system. Ciss\u00e9 spent two years in the system, before graduating to the first team in 1998. After playing for Auxerre for six seasons, scoring 90 goals in 166 appearances, he moved to Premier League club Liverpool in 2004.\nDuring his time at Anfield, Ciss\u00e9 played 79 games, scoring 24 times and winning the 2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League and 2005\u201306 FA Cup. He went on to play in Greece with Panathinaikos, Italy with S.S. Lazio, Qatar with Al-Gharafa and Russia with Kuban Krasnodar. He also had further spells in English football with Sunderland and Queens Park Rangers, and France with Olympique de Marseille and SC Bastia. In 2015, Ciss\u00e9 made one appearance for R\u00e9union based club JS Saint-Pierroise, before retiring from professional football. In the course of his career, Ciss\u00e9 suffered from two leg breaks, breaking his left leg in 2004, and his right leg in 2006.Ciss\u00e9 represented the France national football team at the 2002 and 2010 FIFA World Cups and was also part of les Bleus' 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup winning squad.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Auxerre ===\nAfter starting his career with N\u00eemes Olympique, Ciss\u00e9 signed for AJ Auxerre at the age of 15. Playing for the youth team in 1999, Ciss\u00e9 won the Coupe Gambardella, the equivalent of the FA Youth Cup. After being promoted to the first team squad by coach Guy Roux, Ciss\u00e9 made his Ligue 1 debut at the age of 17 as a substitute against Paris Saint-Germain on 20 March 1999. His first goal came at the start of the 2000\u201301 season in a 2\u20131 defeat of FC Metz. He ended this season, his first as a regular in the first team, with eight goals from 25 games.In the 2001\u201302 season, Ciss\u00e9 was the top scorer in Ligue 1 with 22 goals from 29 matches, as Auxerre finished in third place and qualified for the 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League. Ciss\u00e9's form saw him make his debut for the France national team and earn a place in the team's squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.Ciss\u00e9 was again amongst the league's top scorers in 2002\u201303 with 14 goals. He also scored six goals in six matches in Auxerre's successful Coupe de France campaign, including both goals in the semi-final defeat of Stade Rennais and the equalisier in the 2003 Coupe de France Final victory over PSG.2003\u201304 proved to be Ciss\u00e9's most successful goalscoring season, with 30 goals in all competitions, including 26 in Ligue 1 to win the golden boot for the second time.Overall, Ciss\u00e9 scored 70 goals in 128 league games for Auxerre, before signing for Liverpool in a deal worth over \u00a314 million in the summer of 2004.\n\n\n=== Liverpool ===\nAt Liverpool, Ciss\u00e9 scored 5 goals in 24 first-team games in all competitions for Liverpool in the 2004\u201305 season. He had only played 19 games for Liverpool when a freak accident occurred while playing against Blackburn Rovers on 30 October 2004. While Ciss\u00e9 and Blackburn's Jay McEveley were challenging for the ball, Ciss\u00e9's boot got caught in the turf and his leg snapped. This resulted in a broken tibia and fibula, and physio Daryl Martin said \"It could take six to nine months for a recovery and the absolute worst-case scenario is 18 months...\" Ciss\u00e9 later revealed that had it not been for prompt attention from the trainers at the stadium, he would probably have lost the leg below the knee. He had pins inserted in the leg, and was expected to be out of action for the rest of the 2004\u201305 season.However, in an unexpected return, Ciss\u00e9 was able to come on as a 75th-minute substitute in the second leg of Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final tie with Juventus on 13 April 2005. He went on to score both Liverpool goals in their last Premiership match of the season, a 2\u20131 win over Aston Villa and also converted a penalty in Liverpool's penalty shootout win over AC Milan in the Champions League final. During the 2005\u201306 season, Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez deployed Ciss\u00e9 on the right wing on numerous occasions. While his pace made him well suited to such a role, it was doubtful whether he would be happy to continue in this role rather than in his preferred position as striker. He scored two goals as Liverpool won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup. Ciss\u00e9 also scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 2006 FA Cup Final with a sliding shot past West Ham United keeper Shaka Hislop. Liverpool went on to win 3\u20131 on penalties. He ended the 2005\u201306 season with 19 goals in all competitions.\n\n\n=== Marseille ===\n\nFrom the summer of 2005, the media had linked Ciss\u00e9 with a move away from Anfield. Speculation intensified as the season went on. In early June 2006, it was reported that a transfer to Olympique de Marseille had been agreed. The very same day, Ciss\u00e9 broke his leg during France's final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Ciss\u00e9's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.Ciss\u00e9 made his return to training on 20 October 2006, and scored his first goal for Olympique de Marseille on 22 December 2006 when they beat AS Saint-\u00c9tienne 2\u20131. With only four goals in 14 appearances by April, Ciss\u00e9's performances were drawing such criticism that former player Jean-Pierre Papin urged Ciss\u00e9's critics to be more patient while the striker recovered from his career-threatening injury. Despite the slow start, Ciss\u00e9 managed to score 4 goals in his final 7 league appearances to finish with 8 goals in 21 league appearances, helping Marseille to finish 2nd in the 2006\u201307 season and guarantee a Champions League place for the 2007\u201308 season. On 12 May 2007, he scored two goals in the French Cup Final against Sochaux, although Marseille still lost the match 5\u20134 on penalties, after a 2\u20132 stalemate after extra time following a late equaliser by another Liverpool player on loan Anthony Le Tallec.On 7 July 2007, Marseille's president Pape Diouf announced that the club had struck a deal with Liverpool to sign Ciss\u00e9 permanently, for an estimated fee of \u20ac8 million. But subsequently, Ciss\u00e9 was linked with a return to the English Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers said to be interested. Manchester City had their approach for Ciss\u00e9 rejected by Marseille boss, who said, \"He is wanted, that is for sure, I myself have been approached by Manchester City (about Ciss\u00e9), but I turned it down categorically\". On 26 January 2008, Ciss\u00e9 scored a hat-trick in Marseille's 6\u20131 win against Caen.\n\n\n=== Sunderland ===\nOn 20 August 2008, Ciss\u00e9 secured a loan switch to Premier League club Sunderland. At the same ground where he had scored on his Liverpool debut, Ciss\u00e9 scored the winning header on his debut against Tottenham to make it 2\u20131 to Sunderland. A few days later, Ciss\u00e9 announced his desire to secure a permanent deal with the club. Manager Roy Keane also expressed his desire to sign Ciss\u00e9, telling The News of the World, \"I'd be happy to break the transfer record if Djibril's doing the business\". In the Tyne-Wear derby, Ciss\u00e9 scored his third Sunderland goal on 25 October 2008, with Sunderland winning 2\u20131. After scoring in a 4\u20131 victory against Hull, Ciss\u00e9 stated that despite the departure of Roy Keane from Sunderland, he still wished to complete a permanent move to the club. On 18 April 2009, Ciss\u00e9 scored his 10th league goal of the season in a 1\u20130 victory over Hull City at the Stadium of Light. On 24 May, it was confirmed that Sunderland would not be taking up the option to sign Ciss\u00e9 permanently, and he subsequently returned to Marseille.\n\n\n=== Panathinaikos ===\nOn 25 June 2009, Ciss\u00e9 signed a four-year contract with Panathinaikos. It was reported that the player would earn \u20ac2.5 million per year, while French club Marseille would get an estimated \u20ac8 million as a transfer fee. The total cost of the transfer is about \u20ac20 million, taking into account the various bonuses.

On 30 October 2010, he scored two goals (one penalty) in the Derby of the eternal enemies against arch-rivals Olympiacos in a 2\u20131 home win.

He was also the team captain of Panathinaikos and the most valuable player of the club.\nOn 19 February 2011, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos in Karaiskaki Stadium (2\u20131), after a controversial game. After the game, Ciss\u00e9 had a wrangle with Olympiacos' president Evangelos Marinakis, who also used homophobic slurs against Ciss\u00e9. He was beaten by Olympiacos' fans and stated that he was going to appeal to the UEFA. He stated also that he had lost his patience with the questionable refereeing in Greece: \"I will make my decisions but believe me, I\u2019ve had enough. I can\u2019t go on under these conditions.\" One month later, Ciss\u00e9 reached 50 goals as a Panathinaikos player in domestic and European competitions.
