The following year, the Colombian Football Federation hired him to manage the national team's youth squad and then was quickly promoted to manage the Senior Squad to compete in the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where they reached third place by beating the host Argentina. During this time, he was also hired to manage his former team, Atl\u00e9tico Nacional. Then, in 1989, he had his most successful year in his career.
