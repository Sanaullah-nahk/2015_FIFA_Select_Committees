He was the longtime Chairman of Executive Board of FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen AG, a daughter company of German Bundesliga team Bayern Munich.\nAs a player, Rummenigge had his greatest career success with Bayern Munich, where he won the Intercontinental Cup, two European Cups, as well as two league titles and two domestic cups. He was also honoured twice as European Footballer of the Year.\nA member of the West Germany national team, Rummenigge won the 1980 European Championship and was part of the squad that finished runner-up in the 1982 FIFA World Cup and at the 1986 World Cup.\nRummenigge is a former chairman of the European Club Association, serving in that capacity from 2008 until 2017.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\nRummenigge was born in Lippstadt, North Rhine-Westphalia.\nHe joined Bayern Munich in 1974, coming from the Westphalian amateur side Borussia Lippstadt, for a transfer fee of ca. \u20ac10,000. He immediately showed great strength as a dribbler. His scoring qualities were initially insignificant, but would find great improvement in later years, particularly after the arrival of coach Pal Csernai in 1979. In 1979\u201380, he scored 26 goals and became for the first time the Bundesliga's top striker, a feat he repeated in 1981 and 1984 with 29 and 26 goals, respectively.\nWith Bayern he won the European Cup in 1975 and 1976. In 1975, he did not take part in the final of the competition, whilst in the year thereafter a glass of brandy sufficiently prepared the nervous Rummenigge to contribute to the defeat of AS Saint-\u00c9tienne. In the same year he became also part of the team that prevailed in the Intercontinental Cup finals against Cruzeiro EC from Belo Horizonte.\nIn the era of coach Csernai he found in midfielder Paul Breitner a congenial partner and he formed such a formidable one-two-punch that they were only called Breitnigge (name invented by German newspaper Bild).\nThe club, then often dubbed as \"FC Breitnigge\", won in this period the Bundesliga title in 1980 and 1981, and the DFB-Pokal in 1982 and 1984. A renewed triumph in the European Cup was denied, when the club lost the 1982 final narrowly against Aston Villa. In the season before Rummenigge was top-scorer in this competition with 6 goals.\nHis substantial contribution to the successes of the club and the German national football team found also expression in personal honours. In 1980, he was named German Footballer of the Year and in '80\u201381 the European Footballer of the Year.\nIn 1984, aged 29, he was sold for a record fee of \u20ac5.7m to Inter Milan. Despite a notable beginning, in which he helped the team to compete until the end for the 1984\u201385 Scudetto, Rumenigge's career in Italy was mostly marred by injury problems. At the end of his contract in 1987, Rummenigge moved on to Swiss first division club Servette FC in Geneva, where he saw his career out. In his last season, 1988\u201389, he had his last success, becoming top scorer in the Swiss league with 24 goals.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nWith the West German national team he took part in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, 1982 World Cup in Spain and the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. In 1978, West Germany exited in the second group stage of the tournament. In 1982 and 1986, the team was runner-up behind Italy and Argentina.\nRummenigge also took part in two European Championship tournaments. In the 1980 competition in Italy, West Germany defeated Belgium in the final by 2\u20131 and won the trophy.\nAltogether, between 1976 and 1986, Rummenigge amassed 95 caps and scored 45 goals for West Germany, including one in extra-time in the 1982 World Cup semi-final victory over France, and one in the losing 1986 World Cup final match against Argentina. He also scored a hat-trick in a group stage game against Chile during the 1982 World Cup.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\nOne of the most talented attacking players of his generation, Rummenigge was often lauded as a highly versatile forward, capable of playing as a second striker, winger, or flat-out centre forward. His main strengths were his pace, dribbling, heading and goalscoring ability, from both close range and from outside the box. He also had a penchant for scoring from awkward situations.\nRummenigge was also praised for his both-footedness, leadership and physical strength. However, his later career was greatly affected by injuries, in particular after his move to Inter Milan.\n\n\n== Bayern Munich management ==\n\nIn autumn 1991, Bayern Munich invited Franz Beckenbauer and Rummenigge to return to the club as vice presidents. Rummenigge held this position until February 2002, when he was appointed Chairman of Executive Board of the newly corporatised football department of the club (FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen AG). According to the club, \"in his role as chairman he is responsible for external relations, new media, board affairs and representing the holding company on national and international bodies.\" \nDuring his tenure, Bayern Munich managed to move to their new stadium, Allianz Arena. On 1 June 2021, it was announced that Oliver Kahn will take over his CEO position at Bayern Munich starting 1 July 2021.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nIn April 1983, the British pop duo Alan & Denise recorded a tribute song about his \"sexy knees\" in the song \"Rummenigge\". The single reached number 43 in German charts.From 1990 until 1994, Rummenigge worked as a TV co\u2013commentator for matches of the German national team.\nIn March 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers.\nHis brother Michael Rummenigge was also a noteworthy footballer. He played as forward for Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund from 1982 to 1988 and 1988 to 1994, respectively. He also represented Germany on two occasions between 1983 and 1986.\nRummenigge and his wife Martina have three sons and two daughters born between 1980 and 1991.Rummenigge supports ending the 50+1 rule.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n=== International ===\nScores and results list West Germany's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Rummenigge goal.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\nBayern Munich\n\nBundesliga: 1979\u201380, 1980\u201381\nDFB-Pokal: 1981\u201382, 1983\u201384\nEuropean Cup: 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376\nIntercontinental Cup: 1976West Germany\n\nUEFA European Championship: 1980\nFIFA World Cup runner-up: 1982, 1986Individual\n\nKicker Bundesliga Team of the Season: 1977\u201378, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, 1980\u201381, 1981\u201382, 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384, 1991\u201392\nGu\u00e9rin Sportivo All-Star team: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984\nBundesliga Top Goalscorer: 1979\u201380, 1980\u201381, 1983\u201384\nGoal of the Year (Germany): 1980, 1981\nFootballer of the Year (Germany): 1980\nGu\u00e9rin Sportivo Player of the Year. 1980\nUEFA European Championship Team of the Tournament: 1980\nBallon d'Or: 1980, 1981\nOnze d'Or 1980, 1981\nBravo Otto 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984\nEuropean Cup Top Goalscorer: 1980\u201381\nFIFA World Cup Silver Shoe: 1982\nFIFA World Cup Bronze Ball: 1982\nFIFA World Cup All-Star Team: 1982\nDFB Pokal Top Goalscorer: 1981\u201382\nSwiss League Top Goalscorer: 1988\u201389\nSwiss Foreign Footballer of the Year: 1988\u201389\nFIFA 100\nBayern Munich All-time XI\nGolden Foot, as football legend: 2009\n'Best European Manager' at the Golden Boy Awards by Tuttosport: 2020\nItalian Football Hall of Fame: 2021\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKarl-Heinz Rummenigge at fcbayern.de\nKarl-Heinz Rummenigge at soccer-Europe.com"}}}}
