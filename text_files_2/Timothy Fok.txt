In August 2016, the Hong Kong Economic Journal released an article, accusing the SF&OC and Timothy Fok of various transgressions. In April 2020, the government's Audit Commission released a 141-page report after investigating the Olympic Committee, describing various failures with the SF&OC, including lax governance. A month later, in May 2020, Legislative Council members questioned the Olympic Committee's governance, accusing the SF&OC of lacking transparency when selecting athletes for the 2018 Asian Games. Professor Chung Pak-kwong, former chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, said that the SF&OC \"has grown into an empire and transparency and accountability are not in their dictionary.\"\n\n\n==== Hong Kong Football Association ====\nTimothy Fok has served as president of the Hong Kong Football Association since 1997, after his father held the position for almost 30 years. In July 2020, the Legislative Council's Public Accounts Committee criticized the HKFA under Timothy Fok, stating its governance was \"appalling and inexcusable\". It noted that an internal audit committee, designed to review the association's use of taxpayer funding, was not active between 2015 and 2019, despite receiving HK$34 million in funding for the 2017\u201318 year.

Additionally, he attended less than 30% of 3 separate bills committees he joined. In response, Fok said \"I am going to review this.\" However, two years later in 2010, SCMP reported that Fok's attendance was still last for the 6th consecutive year, and that his participation on some panels had gotten worse. Fok had earlier claimed that attendance records were \"too simple a tool to judge a lawmaker's performance.\"In 2010 Catholic Monitors rated three legislators, one of which was Fok, as less than satisfactory for failing to raise motions or amendments throughout the entire Legco year.\n\n\n=== Family ===\nHe was married to former Miss Hong Kong Loletta Chu.
