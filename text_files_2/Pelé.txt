Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and labelled \"the greatest\" by FIFA, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pel\u00e9 was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record.Pel\u00e9 began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so. He was nicknamed O Rei (The King) following the 1958 tournament. Pel\u00e9 is the joint-top goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games. At club level he is Santos' all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals in 659 games. In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup. Credited with connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football, Pel\u00e9's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a star around the world, and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. During his playing days, Pel\u00e9 was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. Since retiring in 1977, Pel\u00e9 has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the honorary president of the New York Cosmos.\nAveraging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pel\u00e9 was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents' movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. His emergence at the 1958 World Cup where he became the first black global sporting star was a source of inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pel\u00e9 received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport.\n\n\n== Early years ==\n\nPel\u00e9 was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940, in Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born Jo\u00e3o Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two siblings. He was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the \"i\" and call him \"Edson\", but there was a mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as \"Edison\", not \"Edson\", as he is called. He was originally nicknamed \"Dico\" by his family. He received the nickname \"Pel\u00e9\" during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favourite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bil\u00e9, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pel\u00e9 stated he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bil\u00e9, and that it is Hebrew for \"miracle\" (\u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05ab\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0), the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.Pel\u00e9 grew up in poverty in Bauru in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. He earned extra money by working in tea shops as a servant. Taught to play by his father, he could not afford a proper football and usually played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with a string or a grapefruit. He played for several amateur teams in his youth, including Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, S\u00e3o Paulinho, and Am\u00e9riquinha. Pel\u00e9 led Bauru Athletic Club juniors (coached by Waldemar de Brito) to two S\u00e3o Paulo state youth championships. In his mid-teens, he played for an indoor football team called Radium. Indoor football had just become popular in Bauru when Pel\u00e9 began playing it. He was part of the first futsal (indoor football) competition in the region. Pel\u00e9 and his team won the first championship and several others.According to Pel\u00e9, futsal (indoor football) presented difficult challenges; he said it was a lot quicker than football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pel\u00e9 credits futsal for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, futsal allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14 years old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with 14 or 15 goals. \"That gave me a lot of confidence\", Pel\u00e9 said, \"I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come\".\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Santos ===\n\nIn 1956, de Brito took Pel\u00e9 to Santos, an industrial and port city located near S\u00e3o Paulo, to try out for professional club Santos FC, telling the directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be \"the greatest football player in the world.\" Pel\u00e9 impressed Santos coach Lula during his trial at the Est\u00e1dio Vila Belmiro, and he signed a professional contract with the club in June 1956. Pel\u00e9 was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians de Santo Andr\u00e9 and had an impressive performance in a 7\u20131 victory, scoring the first goal in his prolific career during the match.When the 1957 season started, Pel\u00e9 was given a starting place in the first team and, at the age of 16, became the top scorer in the league. Ten months after signing professionally, the teenager was called up to the Brazil national team. After the 1958 and the 1962 World Cup, wealthy European clubs, such as Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United, tried to sign him in vain; in 1958 Inter Milan even managed to get him a regular contract, but Angelo Moratti was forced to tear the contract up at the request of Santos' chairman following a revolt by Santos' Brazilian fans. In 1961 the government of Brazil under President J\u00e2nio Quadros declared Pel\u00e9 an \"official national treasure\" to prevent him from being transferred out of the country.\n\nPel\u00e9 won his first major title with Santos in 1958 as the team won the Campeonato Paulista; he would finish the tournament as the top scorer, with 58 goals, a record that still stands today. A year later, he would help the team earn their first victory in the Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo with a 3\u20130 over Vasco da Gama. However, Santos was unable to retain the Paulista title. In 1960, Pel\u00e9 scored 33 goals to help his team regain the Campeonato Paulista trophy but lost out on the Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo tournament after finishing in 8th place. In the 1960 season, Pel\u00e9 scored 47 goals and helped Santos regain the Campeonato Paulista. The club went on to win the Ta\u00e7a Brasil that same year, beating Bahia in the finals; Pel\u00e9 finished as top scorer of the tournament with 9 goals. The victory allowed Santos to participate in the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament in the Western hemisphere.\n\nSantos's most successful Copa Libertadores season started in 1962; the team was seeded in Group One alongside Cerro Porte\u00f1o and Deportivo Municipal Bolivia, winning every match of their group but one (a 1\u20131 away tie versus Cerro). Santos defeated Universidad Cat\u00f3lica in the semi-finals and met defending champions Pe\u00f1arol in the finals. Pel\u00e9 scored twice in the playoff match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club. Pel\u00e9 finished as the second top scorer of the competition with four goals. That same year, Santos would successfully defend the Campeonato Paulista (with 37 goals from Pel\u00e9) and the Ta\u00e7a Brasil (Pel\u00e9 scoring four goals in the final series against Botafogo). Santos would also win the 1962 Intercontinental Cup against Benfica. Wearing his number 10 shirt, Pel\u00e9 produced one of the best performances of his career, scoring a hat-trick in Lisbon as Santos won 5\u20132.\n\nAs the defending champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final stage of the 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco, the nickname given to Santos for Pel\u00e9, managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pel\u00e9 helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that featured Brazilian greats such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in the first leg of the semi-finals which made it 1\u20131. In the second leg, Pel\u00e9 scored a hat-trick in the Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3 as Santos won, 0\u20134, in the second leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3\u20132, in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1\u20132, in La Bombonera. It was a rare feat in official competitions, with another goal from Pel\u00e9. Santos became the first (and to date the only) Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pel\u00e9 finished the tournament with 5 goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but went on to win the Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo tournament after a 0\u20133 win over Flamengo in the final, with Pel\u00e9 scoring one goal. Pel\u00e9 would also help Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Ta\u00e7a Brasil against AC Milan and Bahia respectively.In the 1964 Copa Libertadores, Santos were beaten in both legs of the semi-finals by Independiente. The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pel\u00e9 netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Ta\u00e7a Brasil for the fourth consecutive year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos reached the semi-finals and met Pe\u00f1arol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie. Unlike 1962, Pe\u00f1arol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2\u20131. Pel\u00e9 would, however, finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals. This proved to be the start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1966, Pel\u00e9 and Santos also failed to retain the Ta\u00e7a Brasil as Pel\u00e9's goals were not enough to prevent a 9\u20134 defeat by Cruzeiro (led by Tost\u00e3o) in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pel\u00e9 scored his 1,000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal, dubbed O Mil\u00e9simo (The Thousandth), occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pel\u00e9 scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.Pel\u00e9 states that his most memorable goal was scored at the Est\u00e1dio Rua Javari on a Campeonato Paulista match against S\u00e3o Paulo rival Clube Atl\u00e9tico Juventus on 2 August 1959. As there is no video footage of this match, Pel\u00e9 asked that a computer animation be made of this specific goal. In March 1961, Pel\u00e9 scored the gol de placa (goal worthy of a plaque), against Fluminense at the Maracan\u00e3. Pel\u00e9 received the ball on the edge of his own penalty area, and ran the length of the field, eluding opposition players with feints, before striking the ball beyond the goalkeeper. A plaque was commissioned with a dedication to \"the most beautiful goal in the history of the Maracan\u00e3\".In 1969, the two factions involved in the Nigerian Civil War agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire so they could watch Pel\u00e9 play an exhibition game in Lagos. Santos ended up playing to a 2\u20132 draw with Lagos side Stationary Stores FC and Pel\u00e9 scored his team's goals. The civil war went on for one more year after this game. During his time at Santos, Pel\u00e9 played alongside many gifted players, including Zito, Pepe, and Coutinho; the latter partnered him in numerous one-two plays, attacks, and goals. Pel\u00e9's 643 goals for Santos was the most goals scored for a single club until it was surpassed by Lionel Messi of Barcelona in December 2020.\n\n\n=== New York Cosmos ===\n\nAfter the 1974 season (his 19th with Santos), Pel\u00e9 retired from Brazilian club football although he continued to occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches. Two years later, he came out of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. At a chaotic press conference at New York's 21 Club, the Cosmos unveiled Pel\u00e9. John O'Reilly, the club's media spokesman, stated, \"We had superstars in the United States but nothing at the level of Pel\u00e9. Everyone wanted to touch him, shake his hand, get a photo with him.\" Though well past his prime at this point, Pel\u00e9 was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the US. During his first public appearance in Boston, he was injured by a crowd of fans who had surrounded him and was evacuated on a stretcher.\n\nPel\u00e9 made his debut for the Cosmos on 15 June 1975 against the Dallas Tornado at Downing Stadium, scoring one goal in a 2\u20132 draw. Pel\u00e9 opened the door for many other stars to play in North America. Giorgio Chinaglia followed him to the Cosmos, then Franz Beckenbauer and his former Santos teammate Carlos Alberto. Over the next few years other players came to the league, including Johan Cruyff, Eusebio, Bobby Moore, George Best and Gordon Banks.In 1975, one week before the Lebanese Civil War, Pel\u00e9 played a friendly game for the Lebanese club Nejmeh against a team of Lebanese Premier League stars, scoring two goals which were not included in his official tally. On the day of the game, 40,000 spectators were at the stadium from early morning to watch the match.Pel\u00e9 led the Cosmos to the 1977 Soccer Bowl, in his third and final season with the club. In June 1977, the Cosmos attracted an NASL record 62,394 fans to Giants Stadium for a 3\u20130 victory past the Tampa Bay Rowdies with a 37-year-old Pel\u00e9 scoring a hat-trick. In the first leg of the quarter-finals, they attracted a US record crowd of 77,891 for what turned into an 8\u20133 rout of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers at Giants Stadium. In the second leg of the semi-finals against the Rochester Lancers, the Cosmos won 4\u20131. Pel\u00e9 finished his official playing career by leading the New York Cosmos to their second Soccer Bowl title with a 2\u20131 win over the Seattle Sounders at the Civic Stadium in Portland, Oregon.On 1 October 1977, Pel\u00e9 closed out his career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. The match was played in front of a sold-out crowd at Giants Stadium and was televised in the US on ABC's Wide World of Sports as well as throughout the world. Pel\u00e9's father and wife both attended the match, as well as Muhammad Ali and Bobby Moore. Delivering a message to the audience prior to the start of the game\u2014\"Love is more important than what we can take in life\"\u2014Pel\u00e9 played the first half with the Cosmos, the second with Santos. The game ended with the Cosmos winning 2\u20131, with Pel\u00e9 scoring with a 30-yard free-kick for the Cosmos in what was the final goal of his career. During the second half it started to rain, prompting a Brazilian newspaper to come out with the headline the following day: \"Even The Sky Was Crying.\"\n\n\n== International career ==\nPel\u00e9's first international match was a 2\u20131 defeat against Argentina on 7 July 1957 at the Maracan\u00e3. In that match, he scored his first goal for Brazil aged 16 years and nine months, and he remains the youngest goalscorer for his country.\n\n\n=== 1958 World Cup ===\n\nPel\u00e9 arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vav\u00e1's second goal. He was at the time the youngest player ever to participate in the World Cup. Against France in the semi-final, Brazil was leading 2\u20131 at halftime, and then Pel\u00e9 scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.\n\nOn 29 June 1958, Pel\u00e9 became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5\u20132 in Stockholm, the capital. Pel\u00e9 hit the post and then Vav\u00e1 scored two goals to give Brazil the lead. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pel\u00e9's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment, \"When Pel\u00e9 scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding\". When the match ended, Pel\u00e9 passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament. His impact was arguably greater off the field, with Barney Ronay writing, \"With nothing but talent to guide him, the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar, and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration.\"It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pel\u00e9 began wearing a jersey with number 10. The event was the result of disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not allocate the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt for Pel\u00e9 who was a substitute on the occasion. The press proclaimed Pel\u00e9 the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi.\n\n\n=== 1959 South American Championship ===\nPel\u00e9 also played in the South American Championship. In the 1959 competition he was named best player of the tournament and was top scorer with 8 goals, as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the tournament. He scored in five of Brazil's six games, including two goals against Chile and a hat-trick against Paraguay.\n\n\n=== 1962 World Cup ===\n\nWhen the 1962 World Cup started, Pel\u00e9 was the best rated player in the world. In the first match of the 1962 World Cup in Chile, against Mexico, Pel\u00e9 assisted the first goal and then scored the second one, after a run past four defenders, to go up 2\u20130. He injured himself in the next game while attempting a long-range shot against Czechoslovakia. This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach Aymor\u00e9 Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was Amarildo, who performed well for the rest of the tournament. However, it was Garrincha who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title, after beating Czechoslovakia at the final in Santiago.\n\n\n=== 1966 World Cup ===\nPel\u00e9 was the most famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars like Jairzinho, Tost\u00e3o and G\u00e9rson, leading to high expectations for them. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for brutal fouls on Pel\u00e9 that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.Pel\u00e9 scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, becoming the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against Hungary. His coach stated that after the first game he felt \"every team will take care of him in the same manner\". Brazil lost that game and Pel\u00e9, although still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender Jo\u00e3o Morais fouled Pel\u00e9, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe; a decision retrospectively viewed as being among the worst refereeing errors in World Cup history. Pel\u00e9 had to stay on the field limping for the rest of the game, since substitutes were not allowed at that time. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.\n\n\n=== 1970 World Cup ===\n\nPel\u00e9 was called to the national team in early 1969, he refused at first, but then accepted and played in six World Cup qualifying matches, scoring six goals. The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was expected to be Pel\u00e9's last. Brazil's squad for the tournament featured major changes in relation to the 1966 squad. Players like Garrincha, Nilton Santos, Valdir Pereira, Djalma Santos and Gilmar had already retired. However, Brazil's 1970 World Cup squad, which included players like Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Carlos Alberto Torres, Tost\u00e3o and Clodoaldo, is often considered to be the greatest football team in history.\n\nThe front five of Jairzinho, Pel\u00e9, Gerson, Tost\u00e3o and Rivelino together created an attacking momentum, with Pel\u00e9 having a central role in Brazil's way to the final. All of Brazil's matches in the tournament (except the final) were played in Guadalajara, and in the first match against Czechoslovakia, Pel\u00e9 gave Brazil a 2\u20131 lead, by controlling Gerson's long pass with his chest and then scoring. In this match Pel\u00e9 attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Viktor from the half-way line, only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak goal. Brazil went on to win the match, 4\u20131. In the first half of the match against England, Pel\u00e9 nearly scored with a header that was saved by the England goalkeeper Gordon Banks. Pel\u00e9 recalled he was already shouting \"Goal\" when he headed the ball. It was often referred to as the \"save of the century.\" In the second half, he controlled a cross from Tost\u00e3o before flicking the ball to Jairzinho who scored the only goal.Against Romania, Pel\u00e9 scored two goals, which included a 20-yard bending free-kick, with Brazil winning 3\u20132. In the quarter-final against Peru, Brazil won 4\u20132, with Pel\u00e9 assisting Tost\u00e3o for Brazil's third goal. In the semi-final, Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2\u20131, and Pel\u00e9 assisted Rivelino for the 3\u20131. During that match, Pel\u00e9 made one of his most famous plays. Tost\u00e3o passed the ball for Pel\u00e9 to collect which Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before Pel\u00e9. However, Pel\u00e9 got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while Pel\u00e9 went to the goalkeepers right. Pel\u00e9 ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.Brazil played Italy in the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pel\u00e9 scored the opening goal with a header after outjumping Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. Brazil's 100th World Cup goal, Pel\u00e9's leap of joy into the arms of teammate Jairzinho in celebrating the goal is regarded as one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history. He then made assists for Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto. The last goal of the game is often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pel\u00e9 made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4\u20131, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pel\u00e9 received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pel\u00e9 during the final, was quoted saying \"I told myself before the game, he's made of skin and bones just like everyone else \u2013 but I was wrong\". In terms of his goals and assist throughout the 1970 World Cup, Pel\u00e9 was directly responsible for 53% of Brazil's goals throughout the tournament.Pel\u00e9's last international match was on 18 July 1971 against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro. With Pel\u00e9 on the field, the Brazilian team's record was 67 wins, 14 draws and 11 losses. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Pel\u00e9 and Garrincha.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\n\nPel\u00e9 has also been known for connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football. A prolific goalscorer, he was known for his ability to anticipate opponents in the area and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful shot with either foot. Pel\u00e9 was also a hard-working team player, and a complete forward, with exceptional vision and intelligence, who was recognised for his precise passing and ability to link up with teammates and provide them with assists.In his early career, he played in a variety of attacking positions. Although he usually operated inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre forward, his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an inside forward or second striker, or out wide. In his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pel\u00e9's unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order to get past players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca. Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.Despite his relatively small stature, 1.73 metres (5 ft 8 in), he excelled in the air, due to his heading accuracy, timing, and elevation. Renowned for his bending shots, he was also an accurate free-kick taker, and penalty taker, although he often refrained from taking penalties, stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score.Pel\u00e9 was also known to be a fair and highly influential player, who stood out for his charismatic leadership and sportsmanship on the pitch. His warm embrace of Bobby Moore following the Brazil vs England game at the 1970 World Cup is viewed as the embodiment of sportsmanship, with The New York Times stating the image \"captured the respect that two great players had for each other. As they exchanged jerseys, touches and looks, the sportsmanship between them is all in the image. No gloating, no fist-pumping from Pel\u00e9. No despair, no defeatism from Bobby Moore.\" Pel\u00e9 also earned a reputation for often being a decisive player for his teams, due to his tendency to score crucial goals in important matches.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\nAmong the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century, Pel\u00e9 is one of the most lauded players in the history of football and has been frequently ranked the best player ever. Following his emergence at the 1958 World Cup he was nicknamed O Rei (\"The King\"). Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated, \"Pel\u00e9 was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic.\" Brazil's 1970 World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined: \"His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game.\" According to Tost\u00e3o, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup: \"Pel\u00e9 was the greatest \u2013 he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pel\u00e9.\" His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed: \"In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful.\" According to Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany's 1974 World Cup-winning captain: Pel\u00e9 is the greatest player of all time. He reigned supreme for 20 years. There's no one to compare with him.\"Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s stated: \"The greatest player in history was Di St\u00e9fano. I refuse to classify Pel\u00e9 as a player. He was above that.\" Just Fontaine, French striker and leading scorer at the 1958 World Cup said \"When I saw Pel\u00e9 play, it made me feel I should hang up my boots.\" England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore commented: \"Pel\u00e9 was the most complete player I've ever seen, he had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch. I remember Saldanha the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pel\u00e9. The man could play in any position\". Former Manchester United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated, \"I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player.\" During the 1970 World Cup, when Manchester United defender Paddy Crerand (who was part of the ITV panel) was asked, \"How do you spell Pel\u00e9?\", he replied, \"Easy: G-O-D.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nSince retiring, Pel\u00e9 has continued to be lauded by players, coaches, journalists and others. Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico, who represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, stated: \"This debate about the player of the century is absurd. There's only one possible answer: Pel\u00e9. He's the greatest player of all time, and by some distance I might add\". French three-time Ballon d'Or winner Michel Platini said: \"There's Pel\u00e9 the man, and then Pel\u00e9 the player. And to play like Pel\u00e9 is to play like God.\" Diego Maradona, joint FIFA Player of the Century, and the player Pel\u00e9 is historically compared with, stated, \"It's too bad we never got along, but he was an awesome player\". Prolific Brazilian striker Rom\u00e1rio, winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and player of the tournament, remarked: \"It's only inevitable I look up to Pel\u00e9. He's like a God to us\". Five-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said, \"Pel\u00e9 is the greatest player in football history, and there will only be one Pel\u00e9\", while Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, two-time UEFA Champions League winning manager, commented: \"I think he is football. You have the real special one \u2013 Mr. Pel\u00e9.\" Real Madrid honorary president and former player, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, opined: \"The best player ever? Pel\u00e9. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are both great players with specific qualities, but Pel\u00e9 was better\".\n\nPresenting Pel\u00e9 with the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, former South African president Nelson Mandela said, \"To watch him play was to watch the delight of a child combined with the extraordinary grace of a man in full.\" US politician and political scientist Henry Kissinger stated: \"Performance at a high level in any sport is to exceed the ordinary human scale. But Pel\u00e9's performance transcended that of the ordinary star by as much as the star exceeds ordinary performance.\" After a reporter asked if his fame compared to that of Jesus, Pel\u00e9 joked, \"There are parts of the world where Jesus Christ is not so well known.\" The artist Andy Warhol (who painted a portrait of Pel\u00e9) also quipped, \"Pel\u00e9 was one of the few who contradicted my theory: instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries.\" Barney Ronay, writing for The Guardian, stated, \"What is certain is that Pel\u00e9 invented this game, the idea of individual global sporting superstardom, and in a way that is unrepeatable now.\"In 2000, the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) voted Pel\u00e9 the World Player of the Century. In 1999, the International Olympic Committee elected him the Athlete of the Century and Time magazine named Pel\u00e9 one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. During his playing days, Pel\u00e9 was for a period the highest-paid athlete in the world. Pel\u00e9's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a star around the world. To take full advantage of his popularity, his teams toured internationally. During his career, he became known as \"The Black Pearl\" (A P\u00e9rola Negra), \"The King of Football\" (O Rei do Futebol), \"The King Pel\u00e9\" (O Rei Pel\u00e9) or simply \"The King\" (O Rei). In 2014, the city of Santos inaugurated the Pel\u00e9 museum \u2013 Museu Pel\u00e9 \u2013 which displays a 2,400 piece collection of Pel\u00e9 memorabilia. Approximately $22 million was invested in the construction of the museum, housed in a 19th-century mansion.\n\nIn January 2014, Pel\u00e9 was awarded the first ever FIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur as an acknowledgment from the world governing body of the sport for his contribution to world football. After changing the rules in 1995, France Football did an extensive analysis in 2015 of the players who would have won the award if it was open for them since 1956\u2014the year the Ballon d'Or award started. Their study revealed that Pel\u00e9 would have received the award a record seven times (Ballon d'or: Le nouveau palmar\u00e8s). The original recipients, however, remain unchanged. In 2020, Pel\u00e9 was named in the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI.According to the RSSSF, Pel\u00e9 is one of the most successful goal-scorers in the world, scoring 538 league goals, a total of 775 in 840 official games and a tally of 1,301 goals in 1,390 appearances during his professional senior career, which included friendlies and tour games. He's ranked among the leading scorer in football history in both official and total matches. After his retirement in 1977 he played eight exhibition games and scored three goals.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== Relationships and children ===\n\nPel\u00e9 has married three times, and has had several affairs, producing several children.\nOn 21 February 1966, Pel\u00e9 married Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi. They had two daughters and one son: Kelly Cristina (born 13 January 1967), who married Dr. Arthur DeLuca, Jennifer (b. 1978), and their son Edson (\"Edinho\", b. 27 August 1970). The couple divorced in 1982. In May 2014, Edinho was jailed for 33 years for laundering money from drug trafficking. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 12 years and 10 months.From 1981 to 1986, Pel\u00e9 was romantically linked with TV presenter Xuxa, which was influential in launching her career. She was 17 when they started dating. In April 1994, Pel\u00e9 married psychologist and gospel singer Ass\u00edria Lemos Seixas, who gave birth on 28 September 1996 to twins Joshua and Celeste through fertility treatments. The couple divorced in 2008.Pel\u00e9 had at least two more children from former affairs. Sandra Machado, who was born from an affair Pel\u00e9 had in 1964 with a housemaid, Anizia Machado, fought for years to be acknowledged by Pel\u00e9, who refused to submit to DNA tests. Although she was recognised by courts as his biological daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993, Pel\u00e9 never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006, nor her two children, Octavio and Gabriel. Pel\u00e9 also had another daughter, Fl\u00e1via Kurtz, in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita Kurtz. Fl\u00e1via was recognised by him as his daughter.At the age of 73, Pel\u00e9 announced his intention to marry 41-year-old Marcia Aoki, a Japanese-Brazilian importer of medical equipment from Pen\u00e1polis, S\u00e3o Paulo, whom he had been dating from 2010. They first met in the mid-1980s in New York, before meeting again in 2008. They married in July 2016.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\n\nIn 1970, Pel\u00e9 was investigated by the Brazilian military dictatorship for suspected leftist sympathies. Declassified documents showed Pel\u00e9 was investigated after being handed a manifesto calling for the release of political prisoners. Pel\u00e9 himself did not get further involved within political struggles in the country.In 1976, Pel\u00e9 was on a Pepsi-sponsored trip in Lagos, Nigeria, when that year's attempted military coup took place. Pel\u00e9 was trapped in a hotel together with Arthur Ashe and other tennis pros, who were participating in the interrupted 1976 Lagos WCT tournament. Pel\u00e9 and his crew eventually left the hotel to stay at the residence of Brazil's ambassador as they could not leave the country for a couple of days. Later the airport was opened and Pel\u00e9 left the country disguised as a pilot.In June 2013, he was criticised in public opinion for his conservative views. During the 2013 protests in Brazil, Pel\u00e9 asked for people to \"forget the demonstrations\" and support the Brazil national team.On 1 June 2022, Pel\u00e9 published an open letter to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on his Instagram account, in which he made a public plea to stop the \"evil\" and \"unjustified\" Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nIn 1977, Brazilian media reported that Pel\u00e9 had his right kidney removed. In November 2012, Pel\u00e9 underwent a successful hip operation. In December 2017, Pel\u00e9 appeared in a wheelchair at the 2018 World Cup draw in Moscow where he was pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Diego Maradona. A month later he collapsed from exhaustion and was taken to hospital. In 2019, after a hospitalisation because of a urinary tract infection, Pel\u00e9 underwent surgery to remove kidney stones. In February 2020, his son Edinho reported that Pel\u00e9 was unable to walk independently and reluctant to leave home, ascribing his condition to a lack of rehabilitation following his hip operation.In September 2021, Pel\u00e9 had surgery to remove a tumour on the right side of his colon. Although his eldest daughter Kely stated he was \"doing well\", he was reportedly readmitted to intensive care a few days later, before finally being released on 30 September 2021 to begin chemotherapy. In November 2022, ESPN Brasil reported that Pel\u00e9 had been taken to hospital with \"general swelling\", along with cardiac issues and concerns that his chemotherapy treatment is not having the expected effect; his daughter Kely stated there was \"no emergency\".\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nA practicing Catholic, Pel\u00e9 donated a signed jersey to Pope Francis. Accompanied with a signed football from Ronaldo, it is located in one of the Vatican Museums.\n\n\n=== Public image ===\nPel\u00e9 is known for frequently referring to himself in the third person.\n\n\n== After football ==\n\nIn 1994, Pel\u00e9 was appointed a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. In 1995, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Pel\u00e9 to the position of Extraordinary Minister for Sport. During this time he proposed legislation to reduce corruption in Brazilian football, which became known as the \"Pel\u00e9 law.\" The Brazilian President had eliminated the post of Sports Minister in 1998. In 2001 Pel\u00e9 was accused of involvement in a corruption scandal that stole $700,000 from UNICEF. It was claimed that money given to Pel\u00e9's company for a benefit match was not returned after it was cancelled, although nothing was proven, and it was denied by UNICEF. In 1997, he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace. Pel\u00e9 also helped inaugurate the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals, alongside supermodel Claudia Schiffer.\n\nIn 1993, Pel\u00e9 publicly accused the Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pel\u00e9's television company was rejected in a contest for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup. Pel\u00e9's accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As a consequence of the affair, the President of FIFA, Jo\u00e3o Havelange, banned Pel\u00e9 from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have damaged Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA's president in 1994.Pel\u00e9 has published several autobiographies, starred in documentary films, and composed musical pieces, including the soundtrack for the film Pel\u00e9 in 1977. He appeared in the 1981 film Escape to Victory, about a World War II-era football match between Allied prisoners of war and a German team. Pel\u00e9 starred alongside other footballers of the 1960s and 1970s, with actors Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone. \nIn 1969, Pel\u00e9 starred in a telenovela called Os Estranhos, about first contact with aliens. It was created to drum up interest in the Apollo missions. In 2001, had a cameo role in the satire film Mike Bassett: England Manager. Pel\u00e9 was asked to participate in the 2006 ESPN documentary film Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos, but declined when the producers refused to pay his requested $100,000 fee.\n\nIn November 2007, Pel\u00e9 was in Sheffield, England, to mark the 150th anniversary of the world's oldest football club, Sheffield F.C. Pel\u00e9 was the guest of honour at Sheffield's anniversary match against Inter Milan at Bramall Lane. As part of his visit, Pel\u00e9 opened an exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand-written rules of football. Pel\u00e9 scouted for Premier League club Fulham in 2002. He made the draw for the qualification groups for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals. On 1 August 2010, Pel\u00e9 was introduced as the Honorary President of a revived New York Cosmos, aiming to field a team in Major League Soccer. In August 2011, ESPN reported that Santos were considering bringing him out of retirement for a cameo role in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, although this turned out to be false.\n\nThe most notable area of Pel\u00e9's life since football is his ambassadorial work. In 1992, he was appointed a UN ambassador for ecology and the environment. He was also awarded Brazil's gold medal for outstanding services to the sport in 1995. In 2012, Pel\u00e9 was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh for \"significant contribution to humanitarian and environmental causes, as well as his sporting achievements\".In 2009, Pel\u00e9 assisted the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In July 2009 he spearheaded the Rio 2016 presentation to the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa General Assembly in Abuja, Nigeria.On 12 August 2012, Pel\u00e9 was an attendee at the 2012 Olympic hunger summit hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, London, part of a series of international efforts which have sought to respond to the return of hunger as a high-profile global issue. Later on the same day, Pel\u00e9 appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, following the handover section to the next host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn March 2016, Pel\u00e9 filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking US$30 million in damages claiming violations under the Lanham Act for false endorsement and a state law claim for violation of his right of publicity. The suit alleged that at one point, Samsung and Pel\u00e9 came close to entering into a licensing agreement for Pel\u00e9 to appear in a Samsung advertising campaign. Samsung abruptly pulled out of the negotiations. The October 2015 Samsung ad in question included a partial face shot of a man who allegedly \"very closely resembles\" Pel\u00e9 and also a superimposed high-definition television screen next to the image of the man featuring a \"modified bicycle or scissors-kick\", often used by Pel\u00e9.In addition to his ambassadorial work, Pel\u00e9 has supported various charitable causes, such as Action for Brazil's Children, Gols Pela Vida, SOS Children's Villages, The Littlest Lamb, Prince's Rainforests Project and many more. In 2016, Pel\u00e9 auctioned more than1600 items from a collection he accumulated over decades and raised \u00a33.6 million for charity. In 2018, Pel\u00e9 founded his own charitable organisation, the Pel\u00e9 Foundation, which endeavours to empower impoverished and disenfranchised children from around the globe.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nSantos\n\nCampeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1968\nCopa Libertadores: 1962, 1963\nIntercontinental Cup: 1962, 1963\nIntercontinental Supercup: 1968\nCampeonato Paulista: 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1973\nTorneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo: 1959, 1963, 1964, 1966New York Cosmos\n\nNorth American Soccer League, Soccer Bowl: 1977\nNorth American Soccer League, Atlantic Conference Championship: 1977Brazil\n\nFIFA World Cup: 1958, 1962, 1970\nTa\u00e7a do Atl\u00e2ntico: 1960\nRoca Cup: 1957, 1963\nTa\u00e7a Oswaldo Cruz: 1958, 1962, 1968\nCopa Bernardo O'Higgins: 1959Individual\nIn December 2000, Pel\u00e9 and Maradona shared the prize of FIFA Player of the Century by FIFA. The award was originally intended to be based upon votes in a web poll, but after it became apparent that it favoured Diego Maradona, many observers complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not Pel\u00e9. FIFA then appointed a \"Family of Football\" committee of FIFA members to decide the winner of the award together with the votes of the readers of the FIFA magazine. The committee chose Pel\u00e9. Since Maradona was winning the Internet poll, however, it was decided he and Pel\u00e9 should share the award.\nCampeonato Paulista Top Scorer: 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1969, 1973\nFIFA World Cup Best Young Player: 1958\nFIFA World Cup Silver Ball: 1958\nFrance Football's Ballon d'Or: 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1970 \u2013 Le nouveau palmar\u00e8s (the new winners)\nSouth American Championship Best Player: 1959\nSouth American Championship Top Scorer: 1959\nCampeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A Top Scorer: 1961, 1963, 1964\nIntercontinental Cup Top Scorer: 1962, 1963\nTorneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo Top Scorer: 1963\nCopa Libertadores Top Scorer: 1965\nBBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year: 1970\nBola de Prata: 1970\nFIFA World Cup Golden Ball (Best Player): 1970\nSouth American Footballer of the Year: 1973\nIncluded in the North American Soccer League (NASL) All-Star team: 1975, 1976, 1977\nNumber 10 retired by the New York Cosmos as a recognition to his contribution to the club: 1977\nElected Citizen of the World, by the United Nations: 1977\nInternational Peace Award: 1978\nFIFA Order of Merit: 1984\nInducted into the American National Soccer Hall of Fame: 1992\nElected Goodwill Ambassador, by UNESCO: 1993\nWinner of France Football's World Cup Top-100 1930\u20131990: 1994\nMarca Leyenda: 1997\nWorld Team of the 20th Century: 1998\nFootball Player of the Century, elected by France Football's Ballon d'Or Winners: 1999\nTIME: One of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century: 1999\nGreatest Player of the 20th Century, by World Soccer: 1999\nAthlete of the Century, by Reuters News Agency: 1999\nAthlete of the Century, elected by International Olympic Committee: 1999\nWorld Player of the Century, by the IFFHS: 2000\nSouth American player of the century, by the IFFHS: 2000\nFIFA Player of the Century: 2000\nLaureus Lifetime Achievement Award: 2000\nFIFA Centennial Award: 2004\nFIFA 100 Greatest Living Footballers: 2004\nBBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award: 2005\nElected best Brazilian player of the century, by the IFFHS: 2006\nGreatest football player to have ever played the game, by Golden Foot: 2012\nFIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur: 2013\nWorld Soccer Greatest XI of All Time: 2013\nLegends of Football Award: 2013\nSouth America's Best Player in History, by L\u2019\u00c9quipe: 2015\nInspiration Award, by GQ: 2017\nGlobal Citizen Award, by the World Economic Forum: 2018\nFWA Tribute Award: 2018\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\nIFFHS All-time Men's Dream Team: 2021\nIFFHS South America Men's Team of All Time: 2021Orders\n\nKnight of the Order of Rio Branco: 1967\nElected Commander of the Order of Rio Branco after scoring the thousandth goal: 1969\nAwarded with the Order of Champions, by the Organization of Catholic Youth in the USA: 1978\nAwarded the FIFA Order as a tribute to his 80 years as a sports institution: 1984\nAwarded with the Order of Merit of South America, by CONMEBOL: 1984\nHe was awarded the National Order of Merit, by the government of Brazil: 1991\nAwarded with the Cross of the Order of the Republic of Hungary: 1994\nKnight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (honorary knighthood): 1997\nOlympic Order, by the International Olympic Committee: 2016Records\n\nJoint-most goals for Brazil national football team: 77 (95 including unofficial friendlies) (tied with Neymar)\nHighest goals-per-game ratio (0.84) for Brazil national football team\nMost goals for Santos: 643 (in 659 competitive games)\nMost goals in the Intercontinental Cup: 7\nMost hat-tricks in world football: 92\nMost career goals in world football (including friendlies): 1,283 (in 1,363 games)\nMost FIFA World Cup winners' medals: 3 (1958, 1962, 1970)\nYoungest winner of a FIFA World Cup: aged 17 years and 249 days (1958)\nYoungest goalscorer in a FIFA World Cup: aged 17 years and 239 days (for Brazil vs Wales, 1958)\nYoungest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup: aged 17 years and 244 days (for Brazil vs France, 1958)\nYoungest player to play in a FIFA World Cup Final: aged 17 years and 249 days (1958)\nYoungest goalscorer in a FIFA World Cup Final: aged 17 years and 249 days (for Brazil vs Sweden, 1958)\nMost assists provided in FIFA World Cup history: 10 (1958\u20131970)\nMost assists provided in a single FIFA World Cup tournament: 6 (1970)\nMost assists provided in FIFA World Cup Final matches: 3 (1 in 1958 and 2 in 1970)\nMost goals in FIFA World Cup Final matches: 3 (2 in 1958 and 1 in 1970) (shared with Vav\u00e1, Geoff Hurst and Zinedine Zidane)\nMost goals in a calendar year (recognised by FIFA): 127 (1959)\nOnly player to reach 25 international goals as teenager\nOnly player to score in a World Cup before turning 18\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nPel\u00e9's goalscoring record is often reported by FIFA as being 1,281 goals in 1,363 games.

He was listed in the Guinness World Records for most career goals scored in football. In 2000, IFFHS declared Pel\u00e9 as the \"World's Best and successful Top Division Goal Scorer of all time\" with 541 goals in 560 games and honoured him with a trophy.The tables below record every goal Pel\u00e9 scored in official club competitions for Santos FC and all matches and goals for the New York Cosmos.\n\n * Indicates that the number was deduced from the list of rsssf.com and this list of Pel\u00e9 games.\n\n\n=== International ===\n\nWith 77 goals in 92 official appearances, Pel\u00e9 is the joint-top scorer of the Brazil national football team (tied with Neymar).
