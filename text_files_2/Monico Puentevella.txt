He is set to be induced to the IWF Hall of Fame on June 25, 2022 for his contribution as a sport official.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n'Newks\u2019 as he is fondly called by his contemporaries is not new to public service as he had represented the Lone District of Bacolod in Congress from 2001 to 2010. As a three-term Congressman, Mayor Monico authored thirteen National Laws including the Quarantine Act of 2004, the Cheaper Medicines Law, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines Law and the Alternative Fuel Act of 2004, among others. He also helped authored and co-authored at least 586 house bills and resolutions of Local and National importance. Mayor Monico's name is also synonymous with sports; the former De La Salle Manila stalwart was once voted Chairman of the Philippine Olympic Committee, Commissioner of the Philippine Sports Commission and the current Marketing and Television Committee Director of the Federation International de Football Association (FIFA).\nHelping him in his administration will be a consortium of past, present and future \"servant-leaders\" of the City that follows Mayor Puentevella\u2019 s philosophy to \"work as a team and succeed as one.\" In as such, Bacolod is assured that she is in good hands, ready and willing to upraise her name as one of the prime cities and the top tourist hub of the country.His son Claudio Jesus Raymundo \"Kalaw\" A. Puentevella is an incumbent councilor in Bacolod. His other son Monico \u201cNicky\u201d A. Puentevella, Jr. was appointed as Director of John Hay Management Corporation in 2017.\n\n\n=== Mayor of Bacolod ===\nHe was elected as mayor of Bacolod in 2013.\nIn 2015, Puentevella was suspended for 90-days which started on November 16 and was charged with violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Republic Act 3019) for the alleged overpriced purchase of IT packages worth P26 million using his Priority Development Assistance Funds when he was congressman from 2002 to 2007. These IT packages were for public elementary and secondary schools in Bacolod. Also charged with Puentevella were the late Victorino Tirol, former Department of Education Western Visayas director; and Merryland Publishing chairman Jessie Garcia, supplier of the IT packages. Puentevella denied the accusations and questioned the validity of the information filed against him, however he willfully accepted the suspension with no reported hesitation. As a result, while Puentevella served his suspension, Bacolod Vice Mayor Greg Gasataya sat as acting mayor and Councilor El Cid Familiaran as vice mayor.The Sandiganbayan\u2019s 90-day preventive suspension of Puentevella over graft charges ended on February 14, 2016 and Puentevella was able to return to his previous post as Bacolod City Mayor. Puentevella ran for Mayoralty re-election on the 2016 Philippine local elections but lost to Evelio \"Bing\" Leonardia.It was reported on June 23, 2016 that the Ombudsman ordered a one-month suspension against Puentevella due to failure to immediately suspend two Bacolod City building officials. In July 2014, the Ombudsman ordered the suspension of two building officials after finding them guilty of \"conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service\". Puentevella received a directive from the Ombudsman calling for the implementation of the suspension but issued a reply that the officials concerned are to be suspended on January 1, 2015 citing the unilateral move as in line with \"the spirit of Christmas\". The Ombudsman emphasized on its ruling suspending Puentevella that the earlier suspension order is \"immediately effective and executory\" and that \"there is nothing vague or ambiguous with this wording\". The Ombudsman also said that Puentevella has no authority to move the suspension to a different date. Puentevella said that the one-month suspension is \"moot and academic\" since he is already stepping down from his post as mayor eight days from the date of the report.\n\n\n== Other involvements ==\nMonico also worked as company officer for IPC-Sugar Trading Co., Philsugar, Sugar Planters, RH Fabricators and Designs Inc., and JOSMON Management Co.
