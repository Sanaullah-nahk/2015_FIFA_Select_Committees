During his second stint in Sichuan, Haddadi would help the team reach their first playoff stint in CBA history. He would help the Blue Whales sweep the Zhejiang Lions in the first round and the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in the second round before playing in the championship series against the Liaoning Flying Leopards. Before Haddadi would return to his home nation with Petrochimi Bandar Imam in Iran, he would help finish the job that was needed with the Blue Whales, as he would help lead Sichuan to a 4\u20131 Finals series win over the Liaoning Flying Leopards, and thus becoming the CBA Finals MVP in the process.
