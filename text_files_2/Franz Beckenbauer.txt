{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"152680":{"pageid":152680,"ns":0,"title":"Franz Beckenbauer","extract":"Franz Anton Beckenbauer (German pronunciation: [\u02c8f\u0281ants \u02c8b\u025bk\u014b\u030d\u02ccba\u028a\u0250], audio ; born 11 September 1945) is a German former professional  footballer and manager. In his playing career he was nicknamed Der Kaiser (\"The Emperor\") because of his elegant style, dominance and leadership on the field, and also as his first name \"Franz\" is reminiscent of the Austrian emperors. He is widely regarded to be one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. A versatile player who started out as a midfielder, Beckenbauer made his name as a central defender. He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper (libero).Twice named European Footballer of the Year, Beckenbauer appeared 103 times for West Germany and played in three FIFA World Cups and two European Championships. He is one of three men, along with Brazil's M\u00e1rio Zagallo and France's Didier Deschamps, to have won the World Cup as a player and as a manager; he lifted the World Cup trophy as captain in 1974, and repeated the feat as a manager in 1990. He was the first captain to lift the World Cup and European Championship at international level and the European Cup at club level. He was named in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020, and in 2004 was listed in the FIFA 100 of the world's greatest living players.At club level with Bayern Munich, Beckenbauer won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1967 and three consecutive European Cups from 1974 to 1976. The latter feat made him the first player to win three European Cups as captain of his club. He became team manager and later president of Bayern Munich. After two spells with the New York Cosmos he was inducted into the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame.\nBeckenbauer led Germany's successful bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup and chaired the organizing committee. He worked as a pundit for Sky Germany, and for 34 years as a columnist for the tabloid Bild, both until 2016. In August 2016, it was announced Beckenbauer was being investigated for fraud and money laundering as part of the 2006 World Cup.  The investigation was closed without a verdict in 2020 as the statute of limitations expired.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nFranz Beckenbauer was born in the post-war ruins of Munich, the second son of postal-worker Franz Beckenbauer, Sr. and his wife Antonie (n\u00e9e Hupfauf). He grew up in the working-class district of Giesing and, despite his father's cynicism about the game, started playing football at the age of nine with the youth team of SC Munich '06 in 1954.Originally a centre forward, he idolised 1954 FIFA World Cup winner Fritz Walter and supported local side 1860 Munich, then the pre-eminent team in the city, despite their relegation from the top league, the Oberliga S\u00fcd, in the 1950s. \"It was always my dream to play for them\" he would later confirm. That he joined the Bayern Munich youth team in 1959, rather than that of his favourites 1860 Munich, was the result of a contentious Under-14 youth tournament in nearby Neubiberg. Beckenbauer and his teammates were aware that their SC Munich '06 club lacked the finance to continue running its youth sides, and had determined to join 1860 Munich as a group upon the tournament's conclusion. However, fortune decreed that SC Munich and 1860 would meet in the final and a series of niggles during the match eventually resulted in a physical confrontation between Beckenbauer and the opposing centre-half. The ill-feeling this engendered had a strong effect upon Beckenbauer and his teammates, who decided to join Bayern's youth side rather than the team they had recently come to blows with.In 1963, at the age of 18, Beckenbauer was engulfed by controversy when it was revealed that his then girlfriend was pregnant and that he had no intention of marrying her; he was banned from the West German national youth team by the DFB and only readmitted after the intervention of the side's coach Dettmar Cramer.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\nBeckenbauer made his debut with Bayern in a Bundesliga promotion play-off match on the left wing against FC St. Pauli on 6 June 1964. In his first season in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (\"Regional League South\", then the second level in Germany), 1964\u201365, the team won the league and eventually promoted to the Bundesliga.\nBayern soon became a force in the new German league, winning the German Cup in 1966\u201367 and achieving European success in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967. Beckenbauer became team captain for the 1968\u201369 season and led his club to their first league title. He began experimenting with the sweeper (libero) role around this time, refining the role into a new form and becoming perhaps the greatest exponent of the attacking sweeper game.During Beckenbauer's tenure at Bayern Munich, the club won three league championships in a row from 1972 to 1974 and also a hat-trick of European Cup wins (1974\u201376) which earned the club the honour of keeping the trophy permanently.\n\nSince 1968 Beckenbauer, has been called Der Kaiser by fans and the media. The following anecdote is told (even by Beckenbauer himself) to explain the origin: On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna, Austria, Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I. The media called him Fu\u00dfball-Kaiser (football-emperor) afterwards, soon after he was just called Der Kaiser. However, according to a report in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, this explanation is untrue, though very popular. According to the report, Beckenbauer fouled his opposite number, Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04, in the cup final on 14 June 1969. Disregarding the fans' hooting, Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite part of the field, where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for half a minute. Libuda was commonly called K\u00f6nig von Westfalen (king of Westphalia), so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and invented Der Kaiser.In 1977, Beckenbauer accepted a lucrative contract to play in the North American Soccer League with the New York Cosmos. He played with the Cosmos for four seasons up to 1980, and the team won the Soccer Bowl on three occasions (1977, 1978, 1980).Beckenbauer retired after a two-year spell with Hamburger SV in Germany (1980\u201382) with the win of the Bundesliga title that year and one final season with the New York Cosmos in 1983. In his career, he appeared in 754 competitive club matches.\n\n\n== International career ==\nBeckenbauer won 103 caps and scored 14 goals for West Germany. He was a member of the World Cup squads that finished runners-up in 1966, third place in 1970, and champions in 1974, while also being named to the tournament all-star team in all three editions. He also won the 1972 European Football Championship and finished as runners-up in the 1976 edition. Beckenbauer's first game for the national team came on 26 September 1965.\n\n\n=== 1966 World Cup ===\n\nBeckenbauer appeared in his first World Cup in 1966, playing every match. In his first World Cup match, against Switzerland, he scored twice in a 5\u20130 win. West Germany won their group, and then beat Uruguay 4\u20130 in quarter-finals, with Beckenbauer scoring the second goal in the 70th minute.In the semi-finals, the Germans faced the USSR. Helmut Haller opened the scoring, with Beckenbauer contributing the second of the match, his fourth goal of the tournament. The Soviets scored a late goal but were unable to draw level, and West Germany advanced to the final against hosts England. The English won the final and the Jules Rimet Trophy in extra time. The Germans had fallen at the final hurdle, but Beckenbauer had a notable tournament, finishing tied for third on the list of top scorers\u2014from a non-attacking position. The team returned to a heroes' welcome in their homeland.\n\n\n=== 1970 World Cup ===\nWest Germany won their first three matches before facing England in the second round in a rematch of the 1966 final. The English were ahead 2\u20130 in the second half, but a spectacular goal by Beckenbauer in the 69th minute helped the Germans recover and equalise before the end of normal time and win the match in extra time. West Germany advanced to the semi-finals to face Italy, in what would be known as the Game of the Century. He dislocated his shoulder after being fouled, but he was not deterred from continuing in the match, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions. He stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling. The result of this match was 4\u20133 (after extra time) in favour of the Italians. Germany defeated Uruguay 1\u20130 for third place.\n\n\n=== 1972 European championship ===\nBeckenbauer became captain of the national side in 1971. In 1972, West Germany won the European Championship, beating the Soviet Union 3\u20130 in the final.\n\n\n=== 1974 World Cup ===\nThe 1974 World Cup was hosted by West Germany and Beckenbauer led his side to victory, including a hard-fought 2\u20131 win over the hotly favoured Netherlands side featuring Johan Cruyff. Beckenbauer and fellow defenders man-marked Cruyff so well that the Dutch were never quite able to put their \"Total Football\" into full use.Beckenbauer became the first captain to lift the new FIFA World Cup Trophy after Brazil had retained the Jules Rimet Trophy in 1970. This also gave West Germany the distinction of being the first European national team to hold both the European Championship and World Cup titles simultaneously (two other countries have done it since: France in 2000, and Spain in 2010).\n\n\n=== 1976 European Championship ===\nIn the 1976 competition, West Germany again reached the final, where they lost on penalties to Czechoslovakia. Beckenbauer was named in the Team of the Tournament.\nBeckenbauer retired from international football in 1977, at the age of 31, following his move to New York Cosmos.\n\n\n== Managerial career ==\n\nOn his return to Germany, Beckenbauer was appointed manager of the West German national team to replace Jupp Derwall on 12 September 1984. He took the team all the way to the final of the 1986 World Cup, where they lost to the Diego Maradona inspired Argentina.In 1990, before the German reunification, Beckenbauer managed the last German team without East German players in a World Cup, winning the final 1\u20130, against Argentina, in a rematch of the previous World Cup final. Beckenbauer is one of three men (with Mario Zagallo, and Didier Deschamps) to have won the Cup as player and as manager, and he is the first man and one of only two (with Didier Deschamps) to have won the title as team captain as well as manager.Beckenbauer then moved into club management, and accepted a job with Olympique de Marseille in 1990 but left the club within one year. Marseille eventually won the 1990\u201391 French championship and ended runner-up of the 1990\u201391 European Cup.\nFrom 28 December 1993 until 30 June 1994, and then from 29 April 1996 until 30 June of the same year, he managed Bayern Munich. His brief spells in charge saw him collect two further honours \u2013 the Bundesliga title in 1994 and the UEFA Cup in 1996.In 1994, he took on the role of club president at Bayern, and much of the success in the following years has been credited to his astute management. Following the club's decision to change from an association to a limited company, he has been chairman of the advisory board since the beginning of 2002. He stepped down as president of Bayern in 2009, being succeeded by long-time general manager Uli Hoene\u00df.\nIn 1998, he became vice-president of the German Football Association. At the end of the 1990s, Beckenbauer headed the successful bid by Germany to organize the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He chaired the organizational committee for the World Cup and was a commentator for the Bild-Zeitung.\n\n\n== FIFA inquiries and ban ==\n\nIn June 2014, Beckenbauer was banned by FIFA Ethics Committee for 90 days from any football-related activity for allegedly refusing to cooperate with an inquiry into corruption dealing with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. He protested the ban, as he had requested the questions that were put to him be in German and in writing. The ban was lifted after Beckenbauer agreed to participate in FIFA's inquiry. In February 2016, Beckenbauer was fined CHF 7,000 and warned by FIFA Ethics Committee for failing to cooperate with the inquiry in 2014.In March 2016, the Ethics Committee opened formal proceedings against Beckenbauer regarding the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.In October 2019, Black Mirror Leaks published email correspondence of Russian member of Parliament, Sergey Kapkov, where Beckenbauer and his adviser, Fedor Radmann, were named as recipients of \u20ac3 million for their votes in favour of Russia as host of the 2018 World Cup. Both allegedly received an additional \u20ac1.5 million in success fees after the 2018 cup was allocated to Russia.In 2021, FIFA closed its ethics inquiry against Beckenbauer as the statute of limitations expired.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nBeckenbauer is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the game. He is the only defender in football history to win the Ballon d'Or twice.  He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper or libero, a defensive player who  intervenes proactively in the offensive game of his team. Named European Footballer of the Year twice, Beckenbauer was chosen on the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, and the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002.An icon in Germany, and one of only three men to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a manager, Beckenbauer was lauded by former German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der for winning the World Cup as a player in 1974, winning as manager in 1990, and for playing a leading role in Germany's success of achieving host status of the 2006 World Cup.\n\n\n== Media ==\nDuring his playing career, Beckenbauer's popularity was such that he was included as a character in Monty Python's sketch \"The Philosophers' Football Match\" as the sole genuine player and a \"surprise inclusion\" to the German team. During the match, between famous Greek and German philosophers, instead of actually playing football, the \"players\" walk in circles contemplating philosophy, while \"asking questions\", a popular phrase used by English football commentators, much to the confusion of Beckenbauer.In a 2013 advertisement for South Korean company Samsung, Beckenbauer appeared as the manager of a Galaxy XI of football players from around the globe, and hands the captain's armband to Lionel Messi. Beckenbauer features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was included in the FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nBeckenbauer has been married three times and has five children, one of whom, Stephan, was a professional footballer, who died after a long illness on 31 July 2015, at the age of 46. Stephan's son Luca is also a professional footballer, currently playing for SV Wacker Burghausen in the Regionalliga Bayern. After appearing in an advertisement for a big mobile phone company, Beckenbauer specifically requested the number 0176 / 666666 for his mobile phone. However, he soon was flooded with phone calls by men who thought it was a phone sex number (in German, \"6\" translates to \"sechs\", sounding similar to the word sex).In 2016 and 2017, Beckenbauer had cardiac surgery twice. He also had an artificial hip inserted in 2018.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\n\n\n=== International ===\nScores and results list Germany's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Beckenbauer goal.\n\n\n=== Managing statistics ===\nAs of 22 January 2014\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Player ===\nBayern Munich\nRegionalliga S\u00fcd: 1964\u201365\nBundesliga: 1968\u201369, 1971\u201372, 1972\u201373, 1973\u201374\nDFB-Pokal: 1965\u201366, 1966\u201367, 1968\u201369, 1970\u201371\nEuropean Cup: 1973\u201374, 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376\nEuropean Cup Winners' Cup: 1966\u201367\nIntercontinental Cup: 1976Hamburger SV\nBundesliga: 1981\u201382New York Cosmos\n\nNorth American Soccer League: 1977, 1978, 1980West Germany\nFIFA World Cup: 1974\nUEFA European Championship: 1972\n\n\n=== Manager ===\nWest Germany\nFIFA World Cup: 1990Marseille\nLigue 1: 1990\u201391Bayern Munich\nBundesliga: 1993\u201394\nUEFA Cup: 1995\u201396\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nPlayer\n\nBallon d'Or: 1972, 1976\nFootballer of the Year (Germany): 1966, 1968, 1974, 1976\nkicker Bundesliga Team of the Season: 1965\u201366, 1966\u201367, 1967\u201368, 1968\u201369, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371, 1971\u201372, 1972\u201373, 1973\u201374, 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376, 1976\u201377\nFIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award: 1966\nFIFA World Cup Bronze Boot: 1966\nFIFA World Cup All-Star Team: 1966, 1970, 1974\nFIFA XI: 1968\nFIFA World Cup Silver Ball: 1974\nNASL Most Valuable Player Award: 1977\nFIFA Order of Merit: 1984\nFIFA World Cup All-Time Team: 1994\nUEFA Euro Team of the Tournament: 1972, 1976\nWorld Team of the 20th Century: 1998\nFIFA World Cup Dream Team: 2002\nFIFA Centennial Player and Football Personality Award: 2004\nFIFA 100: 2004\nLaureus Lifetime Achievement Award: 2007\nIFFHS Universal Genius of World Football: 2007\nGolden Foot: 2010, as football legend\nMarca Leyenda: 2012\nFIFA Presidential Award: 2012\nUEFA President's Award: 2012\nWorld Soccer Greatest XI of all time: 2013\nUEFA Euro All-time XI: 2016\nUEFA Golden Jubilee Poll (2004): second place\nWorld Soccer (magazine) The greatest players of 20th century: fourth place\nIFFHS Best European Player 1956\u20131990\nIFFHS World Player of the Century: third place\nIFFHS European Player of the Century: second place\nIFFHS Legends\nBayern Munich All-time XI\nMember of Germany's Sports Hall of Fame\nBallon d'Or Dream Team: 2020\nIFFHS All-time Men's Dream Team: 2021Manager\n\nEuropean Coach of the Year\u2014Sepp Herberger Award: 1990\nWorld Soccer Awards Manager of the Year: 1990\nWorld Soccer 29th Greatest Manager of All Time: 2013\n\n\n=== Civil ===\n Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany: 1976\n Bavarian Order of Merit: 1982\n Cross of Merit 1st Class of the Federal Republic of Germany: 1986\nHonorary Golden Coin of the City of Munich: 1995\nHonorary Doctor of the National Sports Academy: 2004\n Commanders' Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany: 2006\n Lower Saxon Merit 1st Class: 2008\n Order of Merit of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia: 2009\nHonorary consul of the Republic of Kosovo: 2011\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\nList of UEFA Cup winning managers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHesse-Lichtenberger, Ulrich (2002).
