The team's colours, light blue and red, were chosen because of two different reasons. The light blue represents the sky and the red stripe, is in honor to Julio's grandfather, who was a fan of River plate.\nGrondona was president of the club for nearly twenty years, from 1957 to 1976, when he was elected president of Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente. Under his leadership the club was promoted from the lowest rank in the Argentine football league system, the Primera D, in 1962 and once again in 1964, when the team won the Primera C title.\n\n\n=== Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente ===\nWhile holding the river plate presidency, he also held positions in neighboring club Independiente, where he was elected as chair of the professional football subcommittee in 1962. While he was in that role, the team won the 1963 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n, the Copa Libertadores in 1964 and 1965 and the Campeonato Nacional in 1967.\nIn 1970 his Lista Roja lost the club's elections, and he left the club until his return as president in 1976, when he defeated the ruling Jos\u00e9 Epelb\u00f3im in the elections.

It's hard work and you know, Jews don't like hard work.\" In another incident, he went on record saying \"Jews don't like it when it gets rough.\"On May 31, 2011, in an interview with German press, when asked about who he voted for to receive the 2018 and 2030 World Cup hosting rights Grondona said, \"Yes, I voted for Argentina, because a vote for the US would be like a vote for England, and that is not possible [...] But with the English bid I said: Let us be brief. If you give back the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands), which belong to us, you will get my vote. They then became sad and left.\" Grondona later apologized for his attack on England.In 2014 his son, Humberto, a FIFA official, admitted illegally selling tickets for games at the World Cup in Brazil.On June 2, 2015, FIFA blamed Julio Grondona for approving, in 2007, corrupt payments at the center of the United States Department of Justice investigation known as FIFA-gate that led to the 47-count indictment against soccer officials and sports marketing executives.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nLuis Margani portrayed Grondona in the 2020 Amazon Prime Video original series El Presidente.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEstadio Julio H.
